# VarSelect

An innovative selective Sobel framework that efficiently avoids superfluous convolutions within homogeneous image regions by capitalizing on pixel-wise variance.

## Overview

In this work, we present an innovative selective Sobel framework that efficiently avoids superfluous convolutions within homogeneous image regions by capitalizing on pixel-wise variance, named VarSelect.

## Features

- Selective Sobel edge detection
- Pixel-wise variance optimization
- Efficient processing of homogeneous image regions
- Reduced computational overhead

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProfCDuqueTec/VarSelect.git
cd VarSelect
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
# Example usage will be added as the project develops
from varselect import VarSelect

# Initialize VarSelect
vs = VarSelect()

# Process an image
result = vs.process(image)
```
